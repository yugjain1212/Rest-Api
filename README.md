# Student Management REST API ðŸš€

This is a simple **REST API** built using **Go (Golang)** and **SQLite** for managing student records.  
It demonstrates how to build a clean, idiomatic Go web service with persistent storage, supporting full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for students.

I also used **TablePlus** to easily view and manage the SQLite database.
